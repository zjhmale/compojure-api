## Latest version

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/metosin/compojure-api/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/metosin/compojure-api)

## Migration from Swagger 1.2 to 2.0

If you are upgrading your existing pre `0.20.0` compojure-api app to use `0.20.0` or later, you have to migrate the Swagger models
from 1.2 to 2.0. See [Migration guide](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api/wiki/Migration-from-Swagger-1.2-to-2.0) for details.

## Sample application

```clojure
(ns examples.thingie
  (:require [ring.util.http-response :refer :all]
            [compojure.api.sweet :refer :all]
            [schema.core :as s]))

;;
;; Schemas
;;

(s/defschema Thingie 
  {:id Long
   :hot Boolean
   :tag (s/enum :kikka :kukka)
   :chief [{:name String
            :type #{{:id String}}}]})

;;
;; Routes
;;

(defroutes* legacy-route
  (GET* "/legacy/:value" [value]
    (ok {:value value})))

(defapi app
  (swagger-ui)
  (swagger-docs 
    {:info {:title "Sample api"}})
    
  (GET* "/"
    :no-doc true
    (ok "hello world"))

  (context* "/api" []
    :tags ["thingie"]

    (GET* "/plus" []
      :return       Long
      :query-params [x :- Long, {y :- Long 1}]
      :summary      "x+y with query-parameters. y defaults to 1."
      (ok (+ x y)))

    (POST* "/minus" []
      :return      Long
      :body-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
      :summary     "x-y with body-parameters."
      (ok (- x y)))

    (GET* "/times/:x/:y" []
      :return      Long
      :path-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
      :summary     "x*y with path-parameters"
      (ok (* x y)))

    (POST* "/divide" []
      :return      Double
      :form-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
      :summary     "x/y with form-parameters"
      (ok (/ x y)))

    (GET* "/power" []
      :return      Long
      :header-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
      :summary     "x^y with header-parameters"
      (ok (long (Math/pow x y))))

    legacy-route

    (PUT* "/echo" []
      :return   [{:hot Boolean}]
      :body     [body [{:hot Boolean}]]
      :summary  "echoes a vector of anonymous hotties"
      (ok body))

    (POST* "/echo" []
      :return   (s/maybe Thingie)
      :body     [thingie (s/maybe Thingie)]
      :summary  "echoes a Thingie from json-body"
      (ok thingie)))

  (context* "/context" []
    :tags ["context*"]
    :summary "summary inherited from context"
    (context* "/:kikka" []
      :path-params [kikka :- s/Str]
      :query-params [kukka :- s/Str]
      (GET* "/:kakka" []
        :path-params [kakka :- s/Str]
        (ok {:kikka kikka
             :kukka kukka
             :kakka kakka})))))
```

```

# Building Documented Apis

## Api middleware

There is prepackaged middleware `compojure.api.middleware/api-middleware` for common web api usage. It's a enhanced version of `compojure.handler/api` adding the following:

- catching slingshotted http-errors (`ring.middleware.http-response/catch-response`)
- catching model validation errors (`ring.swagger.middleware/catch-validation-errors`)
- catching unhandler exceptions (`compojure.api.middleware/wrap-exceptions`)
- support for different protocols via `ring.middleware.format-params/wrap-restful-params` and `ring.middleware.format-response/wrap-restful-response`
    - default supported protocols are: `:json-kw`, `:yaml-kw`, `:edn`, `:transit-json` and `:transit-msgpack`
    - enabled protocol support is also published into Swagger docs via `ring.swagger.middleware/wrap-swagger-data`.
    
All middlewares are preconfigured with good/opinionated defaults, but one can override the configurations by passing a options Map into the `api-middleware`. See [api-docs](http://metosin.github.io/compojure-api/doc/compojure.api.middleware.html#var-api-middleware) for details.

## Api macro

To get all the benefits of Compojure-api, one should wrap the apis into `compojure.api.core/api`-macro. It is responsible for creating and publishing
the compile-time route-tree from your api, enabling the Swagger documentation. It takes an optional map as a first parameter which is passed directly
to the underlaying `api-middleware` for configuring the used middlewares.

```clojure
(ns example.handler
  (:require [ring.util.http-response :refer [ok]]
            [compojure.api.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.core :refer :all]))

(def app
  (api
    {:formats [:json-kw]}
    (context "/api" []
      (GET "/ping" [] (ok {:ping "pong"})))))
      
(slurp (:body (app {:request-method :get :uri "/api/ping"})))
; => "{\"ping\":\"pong\"}"
```

## Defapi

`compojure.api.core/defapi` is just a shortcut for defining an api:

```clojure
(defapi app
  {:formats [:json-kw]}
  (context "/api" []
    (GET "/ping" [] (ok {:ping "pong"}))))
```

## Custom middlewares

To help setting up custom middleware there is a `compojure.api.core/middlewares` macro:

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.head :refer [wrap-head]])

(defapi app
  (middlewares [wrap-head]
    (context "/api" []
      (GET "/ping" [] (ok {:ping "pong"})))))
```

## Route macros

One can use either [vanilla Compojure routes](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki) or their enhanced versions from `compojure.api.core`.
Enhanced versions have `*` in their name (`GET*`, `POST*`, `context*`, `defroutes*` etc.) so that they don't get mixed up with the originals.
Enhanced version can be used exactly as their ancestors but also allow new features via extendable meta-data handlers.

## Sweet

Namespace `compojure.api.sweet` is a public entry point for all routing macros. It imports the enchanced route macros from `compojure.api.core`,
swagger-stuff from `compojure.api.swagger` and few extras from `compojure.core`. 

There is also `compojure.api.legacy` namespace which contains rest of the public vars from `compojure.core` (the `GET`, `POST` etc. endpoint macros which are not contained in `sweet`). Using `sweet` in conjunction with `legacy` should provide a drop-in-replacement for `compojure.core` - with new new route goodies.

### sample sweet application

```clojure
(ns example.handler2
  (:require [ring.util.http-response :refer [ok]]
            [compojure.api.sweet :refer :all]))

(defapi app
  (context* "/api" []
    (GET* "/user/:id" [id] (ok {:id id}))
    (POST* "/echo" {body :body-params} (ok body))))
```

## Route documentation

Compojure-api uses [Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core/wiki) for route documentation.

Enabling Swagger route documentation in your application is done by:

- Wrap your api-applicaiton into an `api` (or `defapi`).
  - uses macro-peeling & source linking to reconstruct the route tree from route macros at macro-expansion time (~no runtime penalty)
  - if you intend to split your routes behind multiple Vars via `defroutes`, use `defroutes*` instead so that their routes get also collected. **Note:** since `0.20.0` the `defroutes*` are automatically referenced over a Var to get smoother development flow.
  - Add `:no-doc` metadata to any routes you don't want to appear in the documentation
- Add `compojure.api.swagger/swagger-docs` route to publish the swagger spec
- **optionally** Mount `compojure.api.swagger/swagger-ui` to add the [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger-ui) to the web app.

If the embedded (Ring-)Swagger-UI isn't enough for you, you can exclude it from dependencies and create & package your own UI from the [sources](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui):

```clojure
[metosin/compojure-api "0.20.3" :exclusions [metosin/ring-swagger-ui]]
```

### Sample Swagger 2.0 App

```clojure
(ns example.handler3
  (:require [ring.util.http-response :refer [ok]]
            [compojure.api.sweet :refer :all]))

(defroutes* legacy-route
  (GET* "/ping/:id" [id]
    (ok {:id id})))

(defapi app
  (swagger-ui)
  (swagger-docs)
  (context "/api" []
    legacy-route
    (POST* "/echo" {body :body-params} (ok body))))
```

The above sample application mounts swagger-docs to root `/` and serves the swagger-docs from `/swagger.json`.

### The Swagger Docs

The resulting swagger-spec data (published by the `swagger-docs`) is combined from three sources:
- Compile-time route & schema information, generated for you by the lib
- Run-time extra information from the middlewares, passed in with the request
- User-set custom information

#### Compile-time route & schema information

Passed in automatically via request injection.

#### Run-time injected information

By default, the application wire-format serialization capabilities (`:produces` and `:consumes`)
are injected in automatially by the `api` machinery.

One can contribute extra arbitrary swagger-data (like swagger security definitions) to the docs via
`ring.swagger.middleware/wrap-swagger-data` middleware.
 
#### User-set custom information

The `swagger-docs` can be used without parameters, but one can set any valid root-level Swagger Data via it.

##### With defaults:

```clojure
(swagger-docs)
```

##### With API Info and Tag descriptions set:

```clojure
(swagger-docs
  {:info {:version "1.0.0"
          :title "Sausages"
          :description "Sausage description"
          :termsOfService "http://helloreverb.com/terms/"
          :contact {:name "My API Team"
                    :email "foo@example.com"
                    :url "http://www.metosin.fi"}
          :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
                    :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}}
   :tags [{:name "kikka", :description "kukka"}]})
```

See the [Swagger-spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) for more details.

As one might accidentally pass invalid swagger data in, you should validate the end results.
See [wiki](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api/wiki/Validating-the-Swagger-SPEC) for details.

### Customizing Swagger output

One can configure Ring-Swagger by providing options to `api-middleware` for key `:ring-swagger`. See [Ring-Swagger docs](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger#customizing-swagger-spec-output) for possible options and examples.

```clojure
(defapi app
  {:ring-swagger {:ignore-missing-mappings? true}})
  (swagger-docs)
  (swagger-ui)
  ...)
```

### Api Validation

To ensure that your API is valid, one can call `compojure.api.swagger/validate`. It takes the api (the ring handler returned by `api` or `defapi`) as an parameter and returns the api of throws an Exception. The validation does the following:

1. if the api is not an swagger api (does not the `swagger-docs` mounted) and compiles, it's valid
2. if the api is an swagger api (does have the `swagger-docs` mounted):
   - Ring Swagger is called to verify that all Schemas can be transformed to Swagger JSON Schemas
   - the swagger-spec endpoint is called with 200 responses status

```clojure
(require '[compojure.api.sweet :refer :all])
(require '[compojure.api.swagger :refer [validate])

(defrecord NonSwaggerRecord [data])

(def app
  (validate
    (api
      (swagger-docs)
      (GET* "/ping" []
        :return NonSwaggerRecord
        (ok (->NonSwaggerRecord "ping"))))))

; clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
; don't know how to create json-type of: class compojure.api.integration_test.NonSwaggerRecord

```

**TODO**: optionally [validate](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api/wiki/Validating-the-Swagger-SPEC) the swagger spec itself againt the JSON Schema.

### Bi-directional routing

Inspired by the awesome [bidi](https://github.com/juxt/bidi), Compojure-api also supports bi-directional routing. Routes can be attached with a
`:name` and other endpoints can refer to them via `path-for` macro (or `path-for*` function). `path-for` takes the route-name and optionally a map
of path-parameters needed to construct the full route. Normal ring-swagger path-parameter serialization is used, so one can use all supported Schema
elements as the provided parameters.

Route names should be keywords. Compojure-api ensures that there are no duplicate endpoint names within an `api`, raising a `IllegalArgumentException`
at compile-time if it founds multiple routes with same name. Route name is published as `:x-name` into the Swagger docs.

```clojure
(fact "bi-directional routing with path-parameters"
    (let [app (api
                (GET* "/lost-in/:country/:zip" []
                  :name :lost
                  :path-params [country :- (s/enum :FI :EN), zip :- s/Int]
                  (ok {:country country, :zip zip}))
                (GET* "/api/ping" []
                  (moved-permanently
                    (path-for :lost {:country :FI, :zip 33200}))))]
      (fact "path-for resolution"
        (let [[status body] (get* app "/api/ping" {})]
          status => 200
          body => {:country "FI"
                   :zip 33200}))))
```

## Component integration

Stuert Sierra's [Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) is a great library for managing the stateful
resources of your app. There are [several strategies](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-Large-scale-patterns-techniques)
to use it. Here are some samples how to use Component with compojure-api:

### Lexical bind with Components as a function arguments

```clojure
(defn create-handler [{:keys [db] :as system}]
  (api
    (swagger-docs)
    (swagger-ui)
    (GET* "/user/:id" []
      :path-params [id :- s/Str]
      (ok (get-user db id)))))
```

### Passing Components via request

Use either `:components`-option of `api-middleware` or `wrap-components`-middleware
to associate the components with your API. 

Components can be read from the request using `compojure.api.middleware/get-components` or using 
the `:components` restucturing with letk-syntax.

```clojure
(require '[compojure.api.middleware :as mw])

(defapi handler
  (GET* "/user/:id" []
    :path-params [id :- s/Str]
    :components [db]
    (ok (get-user db id))))

(defn app (mw/wrap-components handler (create-system))
```

```clojure
(defapi app
  {:components (create-system)}
  (GET* "/user/:id" []
    :path-params [id :- s/Str]
    :components [db]
    (ok (get-user db id))))
```

To see this in action, try `lein run` and navigate to Components api group.

## Schemas

Compojure-api uses the [Schema](https://github.com/Prismatic/schema) to describe data models, backed up by
[ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger) for mapping the models int Swagger JSON Schemas.
With Map-based schemas, Keyword keys should be used instead of Strings.

### Coercion

Input and output schemas are coerced automatically using a schema coercion matcher linked to a coercion type.
There are three types of coercion and currently two different coercion matchers available (from Ring-Swagger).

The following table provides the default mapping from type -> coercion matcher.

| type       | default coercion matcher        | used with
|------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
|`:body`     | `json-schema-coercion-matcher`  | request body
|`:string`   | `query-schema-coercion-matcher` | query, path, header and form parameters
|`:response` | `json-schema-coercion-matcher`  | response body

One can override the default coercion behavior by providing a coercion function of type
`ring-request->coercion-type->coercion-matcher` either by:

1. api-middleware option `:coercion`
2. route-level restructuring `:coercion`

As the coercion function takes in the ring-request, one can select coercion matcher based on the user selected wire
format or any other header. The plan is to provide extendable protocol-based coercion out-of-the-box (Transit doesn't
need any coercion, XML requires some extra love with sequences). Stay tuned.

Examples on overriding the default coercion can found in the [the tests](./test/compojure/api/coercion_test.clj).

All coercion code uses the internally `ring.swagger.schema/coerce!`, which throws managed exceptions when a value
can't be coerced. The `api-middleware` catches these exceptions and returns the validation error as serializable
Clojure data structure, sent to the client.

One can also call `ring.swagger.schema/coerce!` manually:

```clojure
(require '[ring.swagger.schema :refer [coerce!])
(require '[schema.core :as s])

(s/defschema Thingie {:id Long
                      :tag (s/enum :kikka :kukka)})

(coerce! Thingie {:id 123, :tag "kikka"})
; => {:id 123 :tag :kikka}

(coerce! Thingie {:id 123, :tags "kakka"})
; => ExceptionInfo throw+: {:type :ring.swagger.schema/validation, :error {:tags disallowed-key, :tag missing-required-key}}  ring.swagger.schema/coerce! (schema.clj:88)
```

## Models, routes and meta-data

The enhanced route-macros allow you to define extra meta-data by adding a) meta-data as a map or b) as pair of
keyword-values in Liberator-style. Keys are used as a dispatch value into `restructure` multimethod,
which generates extra code into the endpoints. If one tries to use a key that doesn't have a dispatch function,
a compile-time error is raised.

There is lot's of available keys in [meta](https://github.com/metosin/compojure-api/blob/master/src/compojure/api/meta.clj)
namespace, which are always available. These include:
- input & output schema definitions (with automatic coercion and swagger-data extraction)
- extra swagger-documentation like `:summary`, `:description`, `:tags`

One can also easily create own dispatch handlers, just add new dispatch function to the multimethod.

```clojure
(s/defschema User {:name s/Str
                   :sex (s/enum :male :female)
                   :address {:street s/Str
                             :zip s/Str}})
  
(POST* "/echo" []
  :summary "echoes a user from a body" ; for swagger-documentation
  :body [user User]                    ; validates/coerces the body to be User-schema, assignes it to user (lexically scoped for the endpoint body) & generated the needed swagger-docs
  :return User                         ; validates/coerces the 200 response to be User-schema, generates needed swagger-docs
  (ok user))                           ; the body itself.
```

Everything happens at compile-time, so you can macroexpand the previous to learn what happens behind the scenes.

### More about models  
  
You can also wrap models in containers (`vector` and `set`) and add descriptions:

```clojure
(POST* "/echos" []
  :return [User]
  :body [users (describe #{Users} "a set on users")]
  (ok users))
```

Schema-predicate wrappings work too:

```clojure
(POST* "/nachos" []
  :return (s/maybe {:a s/Str})
  (ok nil))
```

And anonoymous schemas:

```clojure
  (PUT* "/echos" []
    :return   [{:id Long, :name String}]
    :body     [body #{{:id Long, :name String}}]
    (ok body))
```

## Query, Path, Header and Body parameters

All parameters can also be destructured using the [Plumbing](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing) syntax with optional type-annotations:

```clojure
(GET* "/sum" []
  :query-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
  (ok {:total (+ x y)}))

(GET* "/times/:x/:y" []
  :path-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
  (ok {:total (* x y)}))

(POST* "/divide" []
  :return Double
  :form-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
  (ok {:total (/ x y)}))

(POST* "/minus" []
  :body-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
  (ok {:total (- x y)}))

(POST* "/power" []
  :header-params [x :- Long, y :- Long]
  (ok {:total (long (Math/pow x y))})
```

## Returning raw values

Raw values / primitives (e.g. not sequences or maps) can be returned when a `:return` -metadata is set. Swagger,
[ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) and ECMA-262 allow this
(while RFC4627 forbids it).

*note* setting a `:return` value as `String` allows you to return raw strings (as JSON or whatever protocols your
app supports), opposed to the [Ring Spec](https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring/blob/master/SPEC#L107-L120).

```clojure
(context "/primitives" []

  (GET* "/plus" []
    :return       Long
    :query-params [x :- Long {y :- Long 1}]
    :summary      "x+y with query-parameters. y defaults to 1."
    (ok (+ x y)))

  (GET* "/datetime-now" []
    :return org.joda.time.DateTime
    :summary "current datetime"
    (ok (org.joda.time.DateTime.)))

  (GET* "/hello" []
    :return String
    :query-params [name :- String]
    :notes   "<h1>hello world.</h1>"
    :summary "echoes a string from query-params"
    (ok (str "hello, " name))))
```

## Response-models

Key `:responses` takes a map of http-status-code to schema-definitions map
(with optional `:schema`, `:description` and `:headers` keys). `:schema` defines the return model
and get's automatic coercion for it. If a route tries to return an invalid response value,
an `InternalServerError` is raised with the schema validation errors.

```clojure
(GET* "/" []
  :query-params [return :- (s/enum :200 :403 :404)]
  :responses    {403 {:schema {:code s/Str}, :description "spiders?"}}
                 404 {:schema {:reason s/Str}, :description "lost?"}}
  :return       Total
  :summary      "multiple returns models"
  (case return
    :200 (ok {:total 42})
    :403 (forbidden {:code "forest"})
    :404 (not-found {:reason "lost"})))
```

The `:return` maps the model just to the response 200, so one can also say:

```clojure
(GET* "/" []
  :query-params [return :- (s/enum :200 :403 :404)]
  :responses    {200 {:schema Total, :description "happy path"}
                 403 {:schema {:code s/Str}, :description "spiders?"}}
                 404 {:schema {:reason s/Str}, :description "lost?"}}
  :summary      "multiple returns models"
  (case return
    :200 (ok {:total 42})
    :403 (forbidden {:code "forest"})

There is also a `:default` status code available, which stands for "all undefined codes".

### I just want the swagger-docs, without coercion

You can either use the normal restructuring (`:query`, `:path` etc.) to get the swagger docs and
disable the coercion with:

```clojure
(api
  :coercion (constantly nil)
  ...
```

or use the `:swagger` restructuring at your route, which  pushes the swagger docs for the routes:

```clojure
(GET* "/route" [q]
  :swagger {:x-name :boolean
            :operationId "echoBoolean"
            :description "Ehcoes a boolean"
            :parameters {:query {:q s/Bool}}}
  ;; q might be anything here.
  (ok {:q q}))
```

### Swagger-aware File-uploads

Mostly provided by Ring-Swagger. Restructuring `:multipart-params` pushes also `multipart/form-data` as the only
available consumption.

```clojure
(require '[ring.swagger.upload :as upload])

(POST* 
  "/upload" []
  :multipart-params [file :- upload/TempFileUpload]
  :middlewares [upload/wrap-multipart-params]
  (ok (dissoc file :tempfile)))
```

## Route-specific middlewares

Key `:middlewares` takes a vector of middlewares to be applied to the route.
Note that the middlewares don't see any restructured bindings from within the route body.
They are executed inside the route so you can safely edit request etc. and the changes
won't leak to other routes in the same context.

```clojure
 (DELETE* "/user/:id" []
   :middlewares [audit-support (for-roles :admin)]
   (ok {:name "Pertti"}))
```

## Creating your own metadata handlers

Compojure-api handles the route metadata by calling the multimethod `compojure.api.meta/restructure-param` with
metadata key as a dispatch value.

Multimethods take three parameters:

1. metadata key
2. metadata value
3. accumulator map with keys
    - `:lets`, a vector of let bindings applied first before the actual body
    - `:letks`, a vector of letk bindings applied second before the actual body
    - `:middlewares`, a vector of route specific middlewares (applied from left to right)
    - `:parameters`, meta-data of a route (without the key & value for the current multimethod)
    - `:body`, a sequence of the actual route body

.. and should return the modified accumulator. Multimethod calls are reduced to produce the final accumulator for
code generation. Defined key-value -based metadatas for routes are guaranteed to run on top-to-bottom order of the so
all the potential `let` and `letk` variable overrides can be solved by the client. Default implementation is to keep
the key & value as a route metadata.

You can add your own metadata-handlers by implementing the multimethod:

```clojure
(defmethod compojure.api.meta/restructure-param :auth
  [_ token {:keys [parameters lets body middlewares] :as acc}]
  "Make sure the request has X-AccessToken header and that it's value is 123. Binds the value into a variable"
  (-> acc
      (update-in [:lets] into [{{token "x-accesstoken"} :headers} '+compojure-api-request+])
      (assoc :body `((if (= ~token "123")
                      (do ~@body)
                      (ring.util.http-response/forbidden "Auth required"))))))
```

Using it:

```clojure
(GET* "/current-session" []
  :auth token
  (ok {:token token}))
 ```

macroexpanding-1 it too see what's get generated:

```clojure
(clojure.pprint/pprint
  (macroexpand-1 `(GET* "/current-session" []
                    :auth token
                    (ok {:token token}))))

(compojure.core/GET "/current-session" [:as +compojure-api-request+]
 (clojure.core/let [{{examples.thingie/token "x-accesstoken"} :headers} +compojure-api-request+]
  (do
   (if
    (clojure.core/= examples.thingie/token "123")
    (do (ring.util.http-response/ok {:token examples.thingie/token}))
    (ring.util.http-response/forbidden "Auth required")))))
```
